# OpenShift Container Platform playground
Here are my experiments with OpenShift.
They are about Cloud Native Application, Microservices, BlueGreen deployment, A/B Testing, Canary release, Service Mesh, Pipelines and hopefully more.

This repository will follow OpenShift version releases as its branching mechanism.

For more information on how to use this playground change the branch to the latest version.
